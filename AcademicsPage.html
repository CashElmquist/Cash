<h1>Middle School</h1>
<p>Graduating middle school was the biggest thing I remember. It was such a great moment just knowing I was finally done. I was so glad to go through it with my family and friends.</p>

<p>High school football was great. It was such a fun season with all of my friends, winning 7 out of 10 games. I loved all of my coaches and teammates.  My favorite game of the season was our second to last, when we won 42-0.</p>
